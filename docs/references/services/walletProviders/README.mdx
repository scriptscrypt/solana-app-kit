# services/walletProviders

This module provides adapters and services for different Embedded Wallets, allowing a unified interface for interacting with different wallet technologies. Currently supported providers include:

## Modules

- [dynamic](dynamic/README.mdx) - Integration with Dynamic wallet adapter
- [privy](privy/README.mdx) - Integration with Privy embedded wallet
- [turnkey](turnkey/README.mdx) - Integration with Turnkey wallet infrastructure

## Overview

Each wallet provider implementation follows a similar pattern, offering functions for:
- User authentication (login/logout)
- Wallet creation and management
- Transaction signing
- Provider-specific features

Applications can switch between different wallet implementations by using the configuration system and `useAuth` hook which delegates to the appropriate provider.

## Description

SuggestionsCard is a component that presents user suggestions in a visually
appealing card format. The component includes:
- A background image for visual appeal
- User profile picture
- Username and handle display
- Follow button for user interaction

The component uses a layered design approach with background and profile
images, and maintains consistent styling through a dedicated style file.

## Example

```tsx
<SuggestionsCard />
```

Note: Currently uses hardcoded values for user information.
Future iterations could accept props for user data.

# Setting Up LLM Integrations with Solana App Kit

This guide covers two powerful ways to integrate Solana App Kit with LLMs: Cursor IDE integration and Model Context Protocol (MCP) setup.

## Cursor IDE Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Cursor IDE](https://cursor.sh) installed on your machine
- Basic familiarity with Cursor's interface

### Configuration Steps

1. Open Cursor IDE
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Features** > **Docs**
3. Click on **Add new doc**
4. In the URL field, paste the following URL:

```bash
https://docs.solanaappkit.com/llms-full.txt
```

### Using Solana App Kit Documentation in Cursor

Once configured, you can access Solana App Kit's documentation directly within Cursor using the following methods:

#### Method 1: Using @docs Command

Type `@docs` followed by "Solana App Kit" to reference the documentation in your code. For example:

```typescript
// @docs -> Solana App Kit: How to initialize a wallet connection
```

#### Method 2: Local Docs MCP Setup

You can also ask questions about Solana App Kit directly in comments, and Cursor will use the documentation to provide relevant answers and code suggestions.

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Setup

### Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) connects Solana App Kit's functions to LLMs and AI applications, enabling AI-powered interactions with the toolkit. With MCP, you can leverage Solana App Kit's documentation and APIs directly in your AI applications.

### Quick Setup

Install the Solana App Kit Docs MCP server using the following command:

```bash
npx mint-mcp add docs.solanaappkit.com
```

### Configuration Steps

1. After running the installation command, you'll be prompted to select which MCP clients to enable
2. Choose the clients that best suit your development needs
3. The terminal will provide you with the final configuration and usage instructions


### Using MCP in Your Project

Once configured, you can use the MCP server to:
- Query Solana App Kit documentation programmatically
- Access API endpoints with AI-powered context
- Get intelligent suggestions based on the documentation

## Benefits

- **Contextual Help**: Get immediate access to Solana App Kit documentation while coding
- **Smart Completions**: Both Cursor and MCP use the documentation context to provide accurate suggestions
- **Faster Development**: Reduce time spent switching between documentation and code
- **AI-Powered Integration**: Leverage LLMs to interact with Solana App Kit more effectively

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Verify that all URLs and API keys are correctly entered
2. Ensure necessary permissions are granted for both Cursor and MCP
3. Check your network connection and firewall settings
4. Try refreshing or reinstalling the tools if issues persist

## Next Steps

After setting up both Cursor and MCP:
1. Explore the various modules and features available in Solana App Kit
2. Test the AI-powered documentation queries in your development workflow
3. Start building your Solana application with enhanced AI assistance

# Repository Structure

Solana App Kit is organized into a modular structure that makes it easy to find and use the components, hooks, and services you need. This guide will help you understand how the codebase is organized.

## Directory Structure

```
solana-app-kit/
├── src/                  # Source code
│   ├── assets/           # Images, colors, and other static assets

│   ├── config/           # Configuration files and constants
│   ├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks
│   ├── mocks/            # Mock data for development and testing
│   ├── navigation/       # Navigation components and configuration

│   ├── utils/            # Utility functions and helpers
│   └── index.ts          # Main entry point

```

## Key Directories

### Components

The `components` directory contains all reusable UI components, organized by feature or functionality:

- `thread/` - Social feed components
- `wallet/` - Wallet and transaction components
- `tokenMill/` - Token creation and management components
- `pumpfun/` - Token trading components
- And many more specialized components

Each component typically includes:
- The main component file
- Style definitions
- Types and interfaces
- Utility functions specific to that component

### Hooks

The `hooks` directory contains custom React hooks that provide reusable logic:

- `useAuth` - Authentication and user management
- `useFetchNFTs` - NFT data fetching
- `usePumpFun` - Token trading functionality
- `useTradeTransaction` - Transaction handling
- `useAppNavigation` - Navigation utilities
- And more specialized hooks

### Services

The `services` directory contains modules for interacting with external APIs and blockchain:

- `pumpfun/` - Services for token trading
- `tokenMill/` - Services for token creation and management
- `walletProviders/` - Wallet connection services (Privy, Dynamic, Turnkey)

### Screens

The `screens` directory contains full application screens that combine components:

- `Common/` - Shared screens like login, search, etc.
- `SampleUI/` - Example UI implementations
  - `Chat/` - Messaging UI
  - `Threads/` - Social feed UI

### State

The `state` directory contains Redux state management:

- `auth/` - Authentication state
- `thread/` - Social feed state
- `transaction/` - Transaction state
- `store.ts` - Redux store configuration

## Usage Patterns

### Importing Components

```jsx
// Import a component
import { Thread } from 'solana-app-kit';

// Or import from a specific path
import Thread from 'solana-app-kit/components/thread/Thread';
```

### Using Hooks

```jsx
// Import hooks
import { useAuth, useFetchNFTs } from 'solana-app-kit/hooks';

function MyComponent() {
  const { user, wallet } = useAuth();
  const { nfts, loading } = useFetchNFTs(wallet?.publicKey);
  
  // Use the data...
}
```

### Using Services

```jsx
// Import services
import { pumpfunService } from 'solana-app-kit/services';

async function buyToken() {
  try {
    const result = await pumpfunService.buyTokenViaPumpfun({
      // parameters...
    });
    // Handle result
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle error
  }
}
```

## Customization Points

Solana App Kit is designed to be customizable at various levels:

1. **Theme Customization** - Through the `CustomizationProvider`
2. **Component Props** - Most components accept customization props
3. **Redux Integration** - You can extend or replace the Redux store
4. **Service Overrides** - You can provide custom service implementations
